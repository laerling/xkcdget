# xkcdget
[pwget](https://github.com/majewsky/pwget) frontend for humans, implementing the [xkcd scheme](https://xkcd.com/936/).
This makes it possible to remember a password better and transcribe it from one screen to another more easily.

You can finally use pwget for login credentials too! Bonus: When you forget your login password you can retrieve it with an arbitrary machine that has pwget installed.
The only password you really need to remember from now on is the master password.

*Tip*: Remember a generated password like `creative_ball_see_author` like e. g. `the creative ball sees the author`. This pseudo-sentence makes a bit more sense than four arbitrary words in a row.

## The word lists

The word lists originate from [here (adjectives)](http://www.talkenglish.com/vocabulary/top-500-adjectives.aspx), [here (nouns)](http://www.talkenglish.com/vocabulary/top-1500-nouns.aspx), and [here (verbs)](http://www.talkenglish.com/vocabulary/top-1000-verbs.aspx).
